# Lab 1: Hangman Game

## Description
This is a console-based version of the classic "Hangman" game, implemented in C#. The game selects a random word that the player attempts to guess, letter by letter. The player has a limited number of guesses, and with each incorrect guess, a part of the hangman is drawn. The objective is to guess the word before the hangman is fully hanged.

## How to Run
To run the game, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio.
3. Build and run the project by pressing `F5` or using the "Start" button in Visual Studio.

## Game Rules
- The game starts by selecting a random word from a predefined list.
- The player is informed of the number of letters in the word and can start guessing letters.
- Each incorrect guess results in a part of the hangman figure being drawn.
- The game continues until the word is correctly guessed or all guesses are used up.

## Techniques Used
- Loops and conditional statements for game logic.
- Arrays to store words and letters.
- Methods to separate functionality and make the code more readable.

## Development Environment
The project is developed with C# in the .NET environment.
