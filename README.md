# Computer and Systems Science, specialisation in Software Development
This is my student repository from my program computer and systems Science, specialisation in software development at the University of Bor√•s

## Overview
The Computer and Systems Science, specialisation in Software Development, is a comprehensive education plan that spans 180 higher education credits. It is designed to develop students' abilities in system and software development across various platforms, tools, programming languages, and application areas.

## Educational Goals
Graduates of this program will have:
- Profound skills in system and software development.
- Theoretical knowledge grounded in computer science traditions.
- The ability to relate theory to practice and apply knowledge to new problem areas.
- Competence in both independent and collaborative development environments.
- An understanding of various development methodologies and the developer's role in larger projects.
- Applied knowledge of basic machine learning from a practical perspective.

## Learning Outcomes
Students will be able to:
- Develop software that meets standard quality requirements.
- Identify and formulate requirements for information systems based on business needs.
- Analyze, design, and model complex systems.
- Plan and execute system and software development projects.
- Apply machine learning techniques and frameworks in system and software development.
- Implement simple computer games with basic applications of artificial intelligence.

## Course Structure
The program is divided into three years, each with a set of courses that build upon each other:
- **Year 1:** Focuses on the basics of system and software development, including programming in imperative languages with an objective of mastering object-oriented programming.
- **Year 2:** Delves into advanced studies in system and software development and basic machine learning, including web and mobile platform development.
- **Year 3:** Further develops skills in modern applications through advanced courses in software development and a major development project, concluding with a course in scientific methodology and an independent scientific work.

## Admission Requirements
- General eligibility plus Mathematics 3b/3c or Mathematics C, Social Studies 1b or Social Studies 1a1 + 1a2, and English 6.

## Degree
Upon completion, students can apply for the following degree:
- Bachelor of Science with a Major in Informatics - Specialisation Software Development.

## Quality Assurance
The program is subject to continuous evaluation to ensure quality. Each course and the program as a whole are evaluated annually, with feedback provided to students via the learning platform.
